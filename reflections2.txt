How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

Staging area is where files are temporarily placed until a commit is made and the file is pushed onto the repository. 


How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

By adding file/files to the staging area(from the working directory) which make for one logical change, we can ensure that we have one commit per one logical change.  


What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

Branches would be helpful when the programmer wants to try out a new experiment on the existing code without breaking it. 
Branches would help create a new copy of the existing code while keeping the working copy intact, hence helping in keeping the code history organised.
